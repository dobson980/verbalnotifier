# Verbal Notifier

The Verbal Notifier Plugin is an enhancement for the RuneLite client, providing audio queues for various game events in Old School RuneScape. This plugin is designed to assist players by offering verbal cues for idle states, low health, and prayer levels.

## Features

**Idle Notifications:** Receive an audio alert when your character goes idle.  
**Hitpoint Notifications:** Get notified when your hitpoints fall below pre-set thresholds.  
**Prayer Notifications:** Alerts for low and critical prayer points, with an option to only notify in combat.  
**Voice Selection:** Choose from multiple voice options for your notifications.  


## AI Generated Voices

Customize your gameplay with a variety of AI-generated voices, each designed to offer a unique auditory experience. Tailor your RuneScape journey with a voice that suits your style!

## How It Works

The plugin monitors game states such as hitpoints, prayer points, and idle status. When certain conditions are met (like hitpoints dropping below a set threshold), it triggers a pre-recorded audio notification. Users can customize thresholds and choose when these notifications should play.

### Idle Notifications
Receive an audio alert when your character goes idle. This verbal notification is activated by a chat message from RuneLite:

Make sure RuneLite's Idle Notifications are enabled. For an optimal experience, we suggest turning off the sound from RuneLite's native notifications:

## Hitpoint Notifications

Receive alerts when your hitpoints drop below set thresholds, customizable in the plugin settings.

## Prayer Notifications

Get notified for low and critical prayer levels. You can also enable notifications to trigger only when in combat.

## Future Enhancements

**Superior Slayer Creature Announcement:** Stay alert with audio notifications for the appearance of Superior Slayer Creatures. This feature aims to ensure you never miss out on these valuable encounters during your Slayer tasks.  
  
**Farming Run Reminders:** Get timely reminders for your farming runs. This addition is designed to help you maximize your efficiency in one of RuneScape's most rewarding skills.  

**More Voices Coming Soon:** We're working on adding a wider range of AI-generated voices for an even more customized experience!
