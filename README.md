# Verbal Notifier

The Verbal Notifier Plugin is an enhancement for the RuneLite client, providing audio queues for various game events in Old School RuneScape. This plugin is designed to assist players by offering verbal cues for idle states, low health, and prayer levels.

## Features

**Idle Notifications:** Receive an audio alert when your character goes idle.  
**Hitpoint Notifications:** Get notified when your hitpoints fall below pre-set thresholds.  
**Prayer Notifications:** Alerts for low and critical prayer points, with an option to only notify in combat.  
**Voice Selection:** Choose from multiple voice options for your notifications.  

## How It Works

The plugin monitors game states such as hitpoints, prayer points, and idle status. When certain conditions are met (like hitpoints dropping below a set threshold), it triggers a pre-recorded audio notification. Users can customize thresholds and choose when these notifications should play.

## AI Generated Voices
Customize your gameplay with a variety of AI-generated voices, each designed to offer a unique auditory experience. Tailor your RuneScape journey with a voice that suits your style!

## Idle Notifications
An audio alert plays when your character becomes idle, helping you maintain efficiency.

## Hitpoint Notifications
Receive alerts when your hitpoints drop below set thresholds, customizable in the plugin settings.

## Prayer Notifications

## Future Enhancements
